# builtwithjon.com

Personal site for Jonathan Malkin. AI builder, solo founder.

Built with [Astro](https://astro.build) v6. Hosted on Cloudflare Workers as `jonathanmalkin-site`. Zero JavaScript by default.

## Local Preview

From this repo:

```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Deploy

Live deploys require both steps:

```bash
git push origin main
npm run build
find dist -name .DS_Store -delete
wrangler deploy --name jonathanmalkin-site --assets dist --compatibility-date 2026-03-18
```

In the broader `Active-Work` workspace, use `Scripts/deploy-website.sh` to run the push, build, cleanup, and Wrangler deploy sequence.

GitHub push alone does not publish the live site.
